	This program will add the current year to a list of copyright years

	Comment markers at the start of each line are preserved on following
	lines, should they be necessary.  A program name is allowed to appear
	after comment markers and before the copyright mark.  Contiguous years
	of 2 or more years are replaced with a year range, e.g. "2008-2011".
	Two digit years will trigger a diagnostic and the copyright will not
	get updated.

	The file modification time is left unchanged.  Copyright lines are
	constrained to 80 columns, unless @option{--width} is specified.  Any
	prefix used on the first line must also used on any continuation
	lines and will be added in if the result requires additional lines.

	The @samp{--copyright-mark} option may be used to change the
	default regular expression used to locate copyright marks.
	The supplied regular expression should have at least one
	subexpression, e.g. @i{(Copyright \\(c\\))}.  The first character
	of the full match is presumed to be the start of the copyright mark
	and the first non-whitespace character after the subexpression match
	is presumed to be the start of the year list.

	This option may also be embedded in the file to be updated.  The
	string ``--copyright-mark'' is searched for.  If found, the option
	argument is presumed to follow it.  That value may be separated from
	this string by at least one of a colon, an equal sign or white space,
	though the colon and equal sign may also be surrounded by white space.

	The argument value may be quoted with double quotes or apostrophes.
	The former will process backslashes the way they are done in C quoted
	strings.  The latter will not process backslashes @strong{except} in
	front of backslashes and apostrophes.  If quoted, the string may
	continue on the next line by ending the line with a quote character,
	white space, and a backslash.  Otherwise quoted text ends with a
	matching quote and unquoted option arguments end with the end of the
	line.
